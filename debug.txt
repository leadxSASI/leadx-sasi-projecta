To regenerate this HTML, follow these strict guidelines:
Structure and Doctype: Start with  and . Include a  with meta tags for charset (UTF-8), viewport (width=device-width, initial-scale=1), title ("WaCrop — Ultra Floating Tile Viewer (Fixed + UI)"), description ("Updated WaCrop with fixed buttons and floating viewer."), and a link to Google Fonts (Inter family with weights 400,500,600,700,800). Link to CropperJS CSS from unpkg.com (version 1.6.2).
CSS Styles: Embed all styles in a  tag inside . Use CSS variables in :root for colors (e.g., --bg: #0b0d10, --text: #e7ecf3, --accent: #59c1ff), spacings, radii, shadows, etc. Define global resets (* {box-sizing:border-box}), body background gradient, font family (Inter), and anti-aliasing. Include styles for containers, cards, buttons (btn, abtn variants), navigation, hero with top-shade gradients, panels, slider (.stage, .track, .slide, .dots), comments section (though minimal), tile cutter (.tc-wrap, .tc-preview, controls), modal overlay with animations (@keyframes modalFadeOut), preview grid with tile animations (@keyframes zoomOutAnim), bottom sheet/drawer (.bottom-drawer, fast transitions), preloader (.loading-overlay with spinner and progress), and alternating feature boxes (.features-alt with .feature-box left/right variants, responsive stacking). Ensure responsiveness with media queries (e.g., @media (max-width:720px) for stage aspect, grid stacking). Add performance hints like backface-visibility: hidden. Fix any minor inconsistencies, like ensuring .feature-box.box-right and .box-left use flex for ordering.
Body Content:
Preloader div (#loadingOverlay) with loading box, spinner (@keyframes spin), progress bar.
Header (.site-header) sticky with backdrop-filter, nav with menu button (#openDrawerBtn), brand logo, links, and CTA.
Hero section with top-shade, content grid (text + panel with specs and slider).
Tile cutter section (#tc_section) initially hidden, with tc-wrap card, file input, buttons (Choose image, Open & Crop, Reset, Make 6 Tiles, Download All), panel details table, tc-preview with img#preview, mode buttons (Crop box, Move image), zoom controls.
Alternating features section (.features-alt) with 2 boxes (left/right) using picsum.photos placeholders.
Modal overlay (#tilePreviewModal) for tile previews, with grid and single view (zoom/pan support).
Bottom drawer (#bottomDrawer) with overlay, handle, content rows for menu actions.
Features section with 3-card grid.
Footer with copyright and back-to-top.
JavaScript Scripts: Embed multiple  tags at the end:
Preloader and slider script: Gather media URLs (including IMAGES array), preload with timeouts and progress callbacks, build slider with seamless looping, autoplay, drag gestures, dots, transitions.
Cropper.js from unpkg (version 1.6.2).
escapeHtml helper function.
Tile cutter script: Handle file input, resize images, init Cropper with options (aspect 3/2, viewMode 2), split into 6 tiles with insets, modal grid/single with animations, zoom/pan in single view, mode toggles, reset.
Bottom drawer script: Open/close with fast transitions, drag handle, menu shortcuts wiring to buttons.
Additional script: Set year in footer, reveal animations on load (wait for preloader:dismissed event), show/hide tc_section on clicks, button visibility logic.
Advanced Requirements:
Ensure full responsiveness: Slider aspect changes at 720px, grids stack at 780px/860px, max-heights for previews.
Animations: Use cubic-bezier for smooth entries/exits, stagger tile shows in modal, reverse-stagger on close, fast drawer (0.06s linear).
Accessibility: ARIA attributes (roles, labels, live regions), keyboard nav (Esc close, arrows for slider/single), focus management.
Performance: Limit data points, use will-change, backface-hidden, imageSmoothingQuality 'high', debounce resizes.
Edge Cases: Handle no images, fallback splitting, cross-origin images, touch/pinch zoom, pointer events.
Enhancements: Add subtle improvements like clamping canvas in Cropper, better error handling in preloads, ensure no console errors.
Exact Fidelity: Match class names, IDs, placeholders (picsum.photos), constants (e.g., IMAGES array with 5 URLs), timeouts (e.g., AUTOPLAY_DELAY=3000).
Output Format: Generate the full HTML as a single, valid document. Do not add extra comments or explanations in the code. Ensure it's minifiable but readable. Test mentally for no syntax errors.
